                    <p>Finishing Flatiron's Software Enigneering Bootcamp, I am excited and ready to begin my career in the field. Though I have little experience, I believe all of my projects establish the base of my knowledge of website creation. I am always learning, as one needs to do with Software Engineering, and love to face challenges that need to be worked through. I am currently freelancing website assistance, but would love to field emails of a position open for Junior - Mid-Level positions. Thank you!</p>
